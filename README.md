Extensions for webtrees to check and display duplicates and other inconsistencies in the database.

Introduction
-----------

If you have worked for a few years in one of the big genealogy services, chances are that you will get duplicates by using matching services, because the quality of the data is sometimes quite questionable.

Then it is handy to have a function to check the data with visual aids not only for each match individually, but on a screen at the same time.

Installation and upgrading
--------------------------
... in the usual way: Download the zip file, unzip it into the modules_v4 directory, and that's it.

Development
-------------------------

[TODO]
